In 1986, the annotation data layer was created from hand drawn 1:2400 half and 1:1200 quarter section maps.  In 1995, the textual information was converted to an ArcINFO annotation class and held in the ArcStrom data base.  The annotation data layer was converted in 2005 to an ESRI ArcGIS GeoDatabase.  

Within the ArcInfo annotation class there were three subclasses.  The "parcel" subclass contains information about parcels that was  gathered from plats, Registered Land Surveys (RLSs) and other recorded documents; it contains text items such as lot and block numbers, plat names and parcel identifiers.  The "road" subclass contains public road names, generally classified as Federal, State, County or Municipal road names.  The "water" subclass contains text items for lakes, rivers and creeks.

With the conversion to an ArcGIS GeoDatabase, the "parcel" subclass was further divided.  Str_Anno includes lot and block numbers, plat names as well as Common Interest Community names &amp; numbers.</abstract><purpose>The annotation data set is primarily utilized for map creation. 

Text features contained within this data set add value to visual presentations making underlying data easier to interpret and understand.  Features held in this database are utilized in the automated creation of half and quarter section maps.</purpose><supplinf>Ramsey County</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>2005</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>Data set is current and updated weekly.</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>Data set is maintained continuously.
