Open water areas are derived from aerial photography observation and interpretation utilizing stereo processing techniques.  Vector line work was originally stereo plotted from 2003 photography.  All graphical lines contain a character based a layer name that identify the different mapping features.
The flight height for the aerial photography utilized in this project is approximately 5000 feet.  The mapping scale for aerial photography utilized in this project is 1 inch equals 833 feet.</abstract><purpose>Open water areas residing in this data set support many functions including thematic mapping, land records, property assessment, surveying and engineering projects.</purpose><supplinf>Ramsey County</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>20030408</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>Data is based upon the most recent aerial photography available.</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>Scheduled to be updated every 3 years.</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-93.2294</westbc><eastbc>-92.9817</eastbc><northbc>45.1255</northbc><southbc>44.8895</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><place><placekey>Minnesota, Ramsey County</placekey></place><theme><themekey>Open water, creeks, lakes, rivers</themekey><themekt>None</themekt></theme></keywords><accconst>This data set is available to everyone.
