NOTES:
-  The current Metropolitan Council Districts were enacted in 2003.
-  Council member names and spellings are taken directly from the Metropolitan Council web site and press releases.
-  Hanover, New Prague, Northfield, and Rockford have been removed from the district boundaries.
-  Only the cities of Minneapolis, St. Paul and Eagan have significant populations split into more than one Council District.  Chanhassen, Hastings and Spring Lake Park have small areas accross county boundaries in another Council district.
- The actual descriptions of Metropolitan Council District boundaries were taken from Minnesota Statutes 2003, 473.123  http://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/stats/473/123.html

Some additional lines were derived from heads up digitizing of the TLG street centerline data, Minneapolis neighborhood boundaries, 2004 USGS High Resolution Orthoimagery, and the 1997 Metropolitan Council digital orthophotos.  Where divided highways serve as the boundary between districts, the district border was digitized between the representative TLG centerlines.  Where divided by city or township boundary, the district border is based on the most current quarterly update of the city and township boundary layer.
