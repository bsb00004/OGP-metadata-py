			<abstract>The Growth Management Policy Areas (sometimes called the 2040 Growth Strategy) were developed by Metropolitan Council staff and approved by the Council in December of 1996.  The policy areas are the Urban Core, the Urban Area, the Urban Reserve, Rural Growth Centers and Permanent Rural and Agricultural Areas.  Additionally an Illustrative 2020 MUSA is depicted.

NOTES:
- Data were derived from MUSA, MCD and watershed layers
- The Illustrative 2020 MUSA category is basically a cartoon.  It was put on the growth management map to convey the idea that there will be an interim 2020 MUSA.  The actual boundaries have yet to be determined and may look VERY different.
- The lines between the Permanent Rural and Permanent Agricultural areas will also be more precisely determined in the future.</abstract>

Note that the ''Illustrative 2020 MUSA'' category is basically a cartoon.  It was put on the growth management map to convey the idea that there will be an interim 2020 MUSA.  The actual boundaries have yet to be determined and may look VERY different.  The positional accuracy of this category is therefore + or - many miles.</horizpar>

				<procdesc>Boundary lines for the Growth Management Policy Areas were derived from several souces.

Census tracts were used to define the Urban Core.  The 2000 Metropolitan Urban Service Area (MUSA) layer (as of 1995) was used to define the Urban Area.  Watershed boundaries and municipal boundaries were used to define the remaining policy areas with the exception of the Illustrative 2020 MUSA.  This 'Illustrative' area was heads-up digitized with very crude boundaries.  The actual boundaries have yet to be determined and may look very different.

Also note that some arbitrary lines were used to connect municipal and watershed boundaries in some locations.</procdesc>
