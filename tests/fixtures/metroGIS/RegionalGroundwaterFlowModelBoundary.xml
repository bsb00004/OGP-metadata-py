Groundwater flow in the Twin Cities metropolitan area was modeled using the finite difference modeling code MODFLOW-96 (McDonald and Harbaugh, 1988; Harbaugh and McDonald, 1996) as implemented in the modeling package Groundwater Vistas (version 5.09 build 16) (Environmental Simulations, Inc., 2007). Using the finite-difference approximation to solve the groundwater flow equation requires the conceptual model domain to be subdivited into a set of blocks, but not all of these blocks are needed to calculate flow within the area of interest. Some grid cells, or "blocks", were therefore defined as inactive. This dataset was developed by Barr Engineering Company for the Metropolitan Council to support the development of Metro Model 2.

More information about this process is provided in the 2009 Metropolitan Council report 'Twin Cities Metropolitan Area Regional Groundwater Flow Model Version 2.00 - Technical Report in Support of the Metropolitan Area Master Water Supply Plan', which is available online at www.metrocouncil.org/environment/WaterSupply/metrogroundwatermodeldatasets.htm.</abstract><purpose>The 2005 Minnesota Legislature directed the Metropolitan Council to "carry out planning activities addressing the water supply needs of the metropolitan area" (Minnesota Statutes, Section 473.1565). Specifically the Council is charged with developing a base of technical information for water supply planning decisions and to prepare a metropolitan area master water supply plan. This dataset supports this charge.</purpose><supplinf>Twin Cities metropolitan area and parts of surrounding counties</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>20090326</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>Spring 2009</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>As Needed</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-406649.3748240</westbc><eastbc>-536101.010755</eastbc><northbc>5048231.994362</northbc><southbc>4910785.316527</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><place><placekey>Twin Cities, Minneapolis, St Paul, Anoka County, Carver County, Dakota County, Hennepin County, Ramsey County, Scott County, Washington County, Minnesota</placekey></place><theme><themekey>Metro Model 2, groundwater model, conceptual model, domain, active area</themekey><themekt>None</themekt></theme></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>By acceptance of this data, the user agrees to include a copy of the metadata record, including the liability disclaimer, whenever the user transmits or provides the GIS data (or any portion of it) to another user.</useconst><browse><browsen>None available</browsen><browsed></browsed></browse><crossref><citeinfo><title>Datasets described by this metadata:

Polygon was hand digitized to include the Twin Cities metropolitan area and to extend far enough beyond that area to limit the effects of artificial boundary conditions within the area of interest. To the east, the active model area extends into Wisconsin allowing for groundwater flow into the St. Croix River from the east to be accounted for.  o the northwest, the active model area extends to the edge of the Mt. Simon-Hinckley aquifer.  To the west and south, the active model area extends an arbitrary amount to limit the effects of boundary conditions.</procdesc></procstep><srcinfo><srcscale></srcscale></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc Sync="TRUE">Dataset copied.</procdesc><srcused Sync="TRUE">N:\EQA\WaterSupply\MAPS_Make_A_Map\MAM_WaterSupply_2Mar09\MAM_WatSUp_Metadata_23Apr09\MM2_ActiveArea</srcused><procdate Sync="TRUE">20091208</procdate><proctime Sync="TRUE">10043000</proctime></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><indspref></indspref><direct>Vector</direct><mgmg3obj></mgmg3obj><mgmg3til></mgmg3til></spdoinfo><spref><vertdef><altsys><altdatum>Not applicable</altdatum></altsys></vertdef><horizsys><planar><gridsys><gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn><utm><utmzone>15</utmzone></utm></gridsys><planci><plandu>meters</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>NAD83</horizdn><ellips>GRS80</ellips></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><overview><eaover>FID
