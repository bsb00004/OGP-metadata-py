Currently, this file includes station locations for Central Corridor LRT (Green Line), Southwest LRT (Green Line Extension), Cedar Avenue BRT (Red Line), I-35W BRT (Orange Line) and other planned BRT stations. 

Station points are placed on the general location of the future station. For transitways in early design, this could be as generalized as a point at the intersection. This file is not a guarantee of future station locations. This is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. Station locations subject to change without notice or warning. This file does not have any guaranteed measure of accuracy. 

The point dataset was created by using heads-up digitizing referencing aerial photography.
When transitway construction is completed and service begins, the stations will move from this file to TransitwayStations (existing). 

Additional Notes:
- Green, Red and Orange line station locations are managed by Rachel Wiken (see Section 7).  All other station locations are managed by:

- The A Line stations at Snelling &amp; Como will be located on the exit ramps, not in an online configuration as shown. The current pointâ€™s purpose is to show that there will be stations at Snelling and Como Avenues.

- Downtown Minneapolis and Saint Paul BRT station locations have yet to be determined. Stations shown are conceptual.
