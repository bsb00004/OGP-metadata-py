			<attraccr>Synoptic water clarity estimates for an individual lake are generally accurate to within about 0.6 meters based on the standard error of the Y-estimate statistic from the regression model. For more information about the regression model and the accuracy of these estimates, please refer to the detailed citation (Kloiber 2002).</attraccr>
		</attracc>
		<logic>NA</logic>
		<complete>Estimates are provided for all lakes with greater than 10 hectares of open water provided the lake was deep enough to prevent signal confusion with macrophytes and bottom reflectance. Some large shallow lakes could not allways be assessed in this manner. Differences in water levels and vegetation growth result in missing estimates for some years on certain lakes.</complete>

				<procdesc>This table contains estimates of lake water clarity for most lakes in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area larger than 10 hectares (25 acres) for 10 different dates spanning a 25-year period from 1973 to 1998. These data were derived by developing, calibrating, and applying empirical models relating satellite spectral-radiometric data to available ground observations of Secchi depth transparency.

This work was performed on a  Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation. The software used included ArcView 3.x GIS software and ERDAS Imagine image processing software. Ten high-quality, cloud-free Landsat images were selected from those available within a late summer index period (July 15 - September 15, with a preference for August). 

The images were registered to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system using the NAD 83 datum and subsequently resampled using nearest neighbor. Through careful selection of numerous (approx. 40), well-defined, and well-distributed ground control points (GCPs), the positional accuracy (RMSE) are on the order of +or- 0.25 pixels, or 7.5 m. 

An unsupervised cluster-classification of the Landsat image was performed first to differentiate water from terrestrial areas. All seven Landsat bands were used for the classification, and ten classes were specified. Because the spectral-radiometric response from water is significantly different from terrestrial features, water was assigned its own, easily identifiable class. The unsupervised classification map was then used as a binary mask to remove terrestrial areas from the original Landsat image. The resulting water-only image was used for further processing. The image is visually checked for cloud shadows and other anomalies and, if needed, affected areas are masked out of the image.

An unsupervised classification of the water-only image is performed to differentiate water affected by varying concentrations of algae from water affected by vegetation, shoreline and/or bottom effects. Lake bathymetric maps, if available, and an unsupervised classification of the water-only image were used as guides when selecting area of interest (AOI) locations to avoid vegetation, shoreline, and bottom effects. The AOIs were manually delineated using the AOI tool in ERDAS Imagine. Once AOIs were delineated for all lakes in an image, a signature file was output containing the AOI average digital brightness levels for each of seven spectral bands. These data were then saved as a coma delimited text file and imported into Excel. An Excel macro was written to transform the data so it could be imported into MS Access. The data were imported into Access and joined to a table of ground observations of Secchi depth made within seven days of the satellite overpass (later processing restricted this to within one day of each overpass).

The joined MS Access table was exported to a dBase file and then imported into SPSS version 10.0 for statistical analysis. A combination of linear regression techniques were used to develop the best model for each image using Band 1 (blue) and a ratio of Band 1 to Band 3 (blue:red) to estimate the natural log of Secchi depth in meters. The fitted models were applied to the Excel spectral signature file providing estimates of Secchi depth transparency for all lakes in the database. This file was then imported into ArcView and converted to an ArcView dBase file so that it could be joined to the lake sub-basin data layer.</procdesc>
