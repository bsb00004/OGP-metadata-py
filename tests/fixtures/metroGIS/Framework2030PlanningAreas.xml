			<abstract>This dataset depicts the various 2030 Framework planning areas shown on the Council's 2030 Regional Growth Strategies map.  This map is part of the Metropolitan Council 2030 Regional Development Framework adopted January 14, 2004 and amended on December 13, 2006.   See http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/framework/overview.htm for more information (Chapter 3).  Please refer to the actual 2030 Framework Planning Areas map for the details of the 2030 Regional Development Framework growth strategy.  A digital version can be found at http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/framework/PlanningAreas8X11.jpg

This dataset is intended to supplement the framework document as a planning guide.  For questions about how decisions were made regarding individual communities' geographic planning areas, please contact the Metropolitan Council Regional Framework Development staff, John Kari, 651-602-1548.

See Lineage in Section 2 of this metadata for more information.</abstract>

			<current>Planning areas were first defined to analyze land use and development trends and socio-economic characteristics to assist in preparing the Council's 1975 Metropolitan Development Framework.  They have subsequently been used for a wide range of general analysis purposes.  These areas were defined to reflect stages of development of metropolitan area communities.  A major factor in their determination has been the proportion of land developed.  As such, these areas have been periodically adjusted to reflect the continued outward growth of the region. The dataset reflects Metropolitan Council approval on January 14, 2004 and 1 amendment approved on December 13, 2006.  No updates have been made to adjust policy area boundaries to match municipal boundary changes since 2004.</current>

				<procdesc>Source data used to define the Geographic Planning Areas of the Growth Strategy
- 2000 Municipal Boundaries
- 2000 Generalized Land Use

Many boundaries from the Comprehensive Plan Composite data were generalized to portray a more general growth strategy policy. 

The 640 polygons in the approved dataset were dissolved into the 6 Geographic Planning Areas plus a category for the 4 metro communities not under Council jurisdiction (Northfield, New Prague, Hanover and Rockford)

The 6 planning areas are further broken down to either Urban or Rural planning areas.  In the Urban Planning area are the Developing and Developed areas.  In the Rural Planning area are the Rural Center, Agricultural, Diversified Rural and Rural Residential areas.  

Several sliver polygons can be seen on screen at the metro scale but 'disappear' when zoomed in to a closer range.  Slivers are not visible when printed on 36x36 inch map or at other map sizes.

The Regional Growth Strategy (titled 2030 Framework Planning Areas) that was adopted on January 14, 2004 was a map that also included:
- Regional Natural Resource Areas (including Terrestrial and Wetland Areas) from the Metro DNR in coordination with the Metropolitan Council (Preliminary Regionally Significant Natural Resources Areas)
- Regional Parks (Regional Recreation Open Space Features)
- 2 proposed Regional Parks (Metropolitan Council Parks and Recreation staff)
- Existing, Planned and Proposed Regional and State Trails (Park Operating Agencies) 
- Transit 2025 Corridor (Transitways on Dedicated Rights-of-Way, 2025 dataset)
- Principal Arterials (Functional Class Roads and Proposed Functional Class Roads, 2002, Principal Arterials only)

The 2030 Regional Framework Planning Areas was ammended in 2006 to include a new planning area designation for East Bethel.

In January 2007, Lake Elmo's comprehensive Plan was finalized. The data and maps were updated in 2010.
