It was built in conjunction with the NCompass Technologies street centerlines and is usually used in conjunction with that dataset. These features cover the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area and beyond (See Place Keywords for list of counties covered by this dataset) as well as three Wisconsin counties (Pierce, Polk, and St. Croix).

The three files that make up the landmark features include Geographic areas of interest (NCompassLandmarkAreas), linear features (NCompassLandmarkLines) and points of interest (NCompassLandmarkPoints). 

Typical features of the NCompassLandmarkAreas layer include parks, lakes, golf courses, cemeteries, airports, etc.  As of the December 1, 1998 release, the NCompassLandmarkAreas layer also contains a municipality field and feature name annotation.
Typical features of the NCompassLandmarkLines layer include railroads and creeks.
Typical features of the NCompassLandmarkPoints layer include city halls, schools, hospitals, etc.

An agreement has been entered into by the Metropolitan Council and NCompass (formerly The Lawrence Group-TLG) that provides access to the NCompass Street Centerline and Landmarks data, at no fee, to all State and Local Government agencies and Colleges and Universities in the State of Minnesota. The Metropolitan Council has funded the licensing of these data for use by these organizations to promote standardization and sharing of geographic information. 

Note: Landmark features from other counties may also be made available as they are completed.</abstract><purpose>This dataset was developed in conjunction with the NCompass Technologies street centerlines. Two key benefits of the file include 1) enhancing map output and 2) automated feature locating.</purpose><supplinf>This dataset covers 22 Minnesota and three Wisconsin counties See Place Keywords for counties covered by this dataset</supplinf></descript><timeperd><current>Dataset is updated monthly

Attributes and features are added and updated in NCompass Technologies internal dataset on a daily basis.  Updating occurs on a city by city basis; therefore, data currency varies. Throughout the course of a year, NCompass Technologies completes an update of the entire Twin Cities Metro Area. 

Users are encouraged to submit perceived data omissions or errors to NCompass Technologies by sending an email describing them to Kevin Etherton, Senior GIS Specialist (kevin.etherton@guidek12.com).  Additions and changes submitted to NCompass Technologies by Minnesota public users is available in the first monthly update that occurs 90 days after the changes are submitted.</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>Monthly</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-94.502</westbc><eastbc>-92.296</eastbc><northbc>45.734</northbc><southbc>44.471</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>geoareas, points of interest, lines of interest, areas of interest, linear, parks, lakes, rivers, hospitals, city halls, schools, creeks, cemeteries, landmarks, shopping centers, streams, base maps</themekey></theme><place><placekey>Minnesota, Twin Cities, Anoka County, Benton County, Blue Earth County, Carver County, Chisago County, Dakota County, Goodhue County, Hennepin County, Isanti County, McLeod County, Morrison, Olmsted County, Pierce County, Polk County, Ramsey County, St. Croix, Scott County, Sherburne County, Sibley, Stearns County, Washington County, Wright County</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>In May of 1997, an agreement for the use of NCompass Technologies (formerly The Lawrence Group) Street Centerline data was completed by Metropolitan Council, Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) and NCompass Technologies. The agreement makes NCompass Technologies Street Centerline data available to all State and Local Government agencies and Colleges and Universities in the State of Minnesota. Mn/DOT and the Metropolitan Council have funded the licensing of the NCompass Technologies Street Centerline data for use by these organizations to promote standardization and sharing of geographic information.</accconst><useconst>All users are licensees and the dataset may be used within the licensee's business, organization, or agency only. A licensee may alter the data if records of updates and changes are provided to the Licensing Agent. Altered data may not be otherwise distributed. NCompass Technologies will be the maintenance provider for the street centerline dataset agreements for specific information.

While for the Minnesota public users mentioned in 'Access Constraints' there is no charge for the license, there are some responsibilities by which users agree to abide. These include:
- Submit roadway and address information additions and changes to NCompass Technologies so that they may be incorporated into the street centerline dataset and made available in future monthly updates. 
- Take measures to prevent the distribution of the NCompass Technologies data to unauthorized users since it is proprietary trade secret information, making it non-public data. 
- Determining appropriate applications for the use of the data are the responsibility of the user.</useconst><browse><browsen>http://www.datafinder.org/metadata/bg/tlg_landmarks.jpg</browsen><browsed>Sample map showing the tlg_landmarks layer.</browsed></browse><native>ARC/INFO UNIX platform, various versions</native><crossref><citeinfo><title>NCompass Technologies Street Centerlines</title></citeinfo></crossref><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>NCompass Technologies</cntorg><cntper>Kevin Etherton</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>Senior GIS Coordinator/Specialist</cntpos><cntaddr><address>9855 West 78th Street, Suite 50</address><city>Eden Prairie</city><state>MN</state><postal>55344</postal></cntaddr><cntvoice>612.598.0438</cntvoice><cntemail>kevin@ncompasstech.com</cntemail></cntinfo></ptcontac></idinfo><dataqual><attracc><attraccr>Feature names are determined from all available sources.

Geographic feature placement is sometimes enhanced through the use of aerial photos and other reference sources. Although, the number of vertices used for polygons and linear features provides a good indication of the shape of a feature, it is not sufficient to indicate precise shapes. 

Points of interest are sometimes placed through geocoding methods and are often dependent on the positional accuracy of the associated street centerline file. Other points may be placed using descriptive sources.</horizpar></horizpa><vertacc><vertaccr>Not applicable</vertaccr></vertacc></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srcscale></srcscale></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>Sources used in the development of the data include hardcopy and digital references including: city planning maps, city reference maps, USGS maps. These various sources have been used since 1988 in the development of the data; and, in most cases, multiple sets of data were referenced in order to justify the existence, location, and attributes. 

Attributes are gathered from numerous sources. Municipalities are the primary source of park information and various government based points of interest.
