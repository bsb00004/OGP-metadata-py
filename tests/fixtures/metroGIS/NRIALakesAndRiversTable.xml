			<abstract>This dataset is a table of characteristics related to the ecological, recreational, and water supply uses of lakes and large rivers in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area. Data on these characteristics are drawn from a variety of sources including the DNR and Met Council. This table also includes several calculated fields. Additional information about the source of these data is given in the Entity and Attribute section of this metadata. This tables can be linked to a geographic representation of lakes and large rivers through the Hydro_luse2000 data layer.

These data were created as a part of a natural resource inventory and assessment for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area.</abstract>
			<purpose>This dataset was developed as a resource for incorporating natural resource protection in to plans for accomodating future growth and development in the Twin Cities. The data are intended to provide a relative rank of the potential regional significance of lakes and large rivers for ecological, recreational, and water supply uses.</purpose>
			<supplinf>Twin Cities 7 County Metropolitan Area.  This includes the counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington in Minnesota.</supplinf>

				<procdesc>The fields in this table provide descriptive information regarding the features contained in the hydro_luse2000 dataset. Several of these fields were created by spatially joining other datasets such as parks, rare and endangered species, sites of biological significance, and public water access sites to the hydro_luse2000 dataset. Other data such as trout information and water supply information were obtained from hard copy documents and added to the table manually. After all required externally derived data were joined to the hydro_luse2000 dataset, these additional fields were exported to this table and editted. Other fields representing the recreational importance and ecological importance were derived by applying criteria developed by the Metropolitan Council in consultation with several other agencies and organizations. Some field specific lineage information can be found in the attribute description section of this metadata.

		<overview>
			<eaover>LAKE_ID:    A unique 8-digit identifier for each lake polygon. The value of
            this field is the DNR Division of Water lake identification number
            (Dowlknum) if one has been assigned.  Otherwise, the Lake_id is a 
            unique sequential number (Autonumber).

AUTONUMBER: A unique 8-digit sequential number beginning with 99 to distinguish 
            the number from the DNR lake ID number.

RNAME:      The DNR registered name of the lake, if one exists.

BIODIV_SIG: Indicates whether an open water feature intersects a site of high 
            biodiversity as identified in the Minnesota County Biological 
            Survey (MCBS).  Values are Y or N.

TROUT:      Indicates whether a lake is a DNR designated trout lake. Large 
            rivers are not designated. Values are Y or N. 

NONMOBILE:  The number of observations within the past 25 years, of rare, 
            endangered, threatened or unusual aquatic species (heretofore 
            referred to as R&amp;E species) that are not mobile outside of an 
            aquatic environment (e.g. fish, mollusks, etc.) associated with an 
            open water feature. 

MOBILE:     The number of observations within the past 25 years of R&amp;E 
            species that are mobile outside of an aquatic environment 
            (e.g. reptiles, birds, etc.) associated with an open water 
            feature. 

BIO_CLASS:  A relative score summarizing the known biologically significant 
            sites based on the Biodiv_sig, Trout, Nonmobile, and Mobile fields. 
            The value is a 1, 2, or 3, with a value of three having the highest 
            probability of important biological features. 

CLARITY:    The average of the satellite-estimated, summer-mean, water clarity 
            depth (equivalent to the Secchi disk transparency depth).  Details 
            of the satellite water clarity estimation procedure can be found in 
            Kloiber et al. (2002) in the journal Remote Sensing of Environment.

CLAR_CLASS: A relative water clarity rank based on the Clarity field. The value 
            is a 1, 2, or 3, with a value of three being the best water clarity 
            condition. 

RIP_VEG:    The fraction of the land area within 60 meters of the shoreline 
            that is covered by natural vegetation.  Values are experessed as 
            real numbers.

RIP_CLASS:  A relative rank based on the amount of natural vegetation in the 
            riparian zone based on the Rip_veg field.  The value is a 1, 2, or 
            3, with a value of three being the best natural vegetation cover. 

PHYS_CLASS: A relative rank of the physical condition of the lake for 
            ecological habitat based on the clarity class and the riparian 
            vegetation class.  The value is a 1, 2, or 3, with a value of three 
            being the best habitat condition. 

ECO_CLASS:  A relative rank of the overall ecological condition of the lake 
            based on the physical habitat condition (PHYS_CLASS) and the known 
            probability of significant biological features (BIO_CLASS).  The 
            value is a 1, 2, or 3, with a value of three being the best overall 
            ecological condition. 

PARK:       Indicates whether or not there is a public park adjacent to a water 
            feature.  Data for park locations was extracted from the 
            Metropolitan Council's 2000 land use dataset.  Values are Y or N.

PWA:        Indicates whether or not there is a public water access(PWA) site 
            for a water feature. Data on PWA provided by the DNR. Values are Y 
            or N.

REC_CLASS:  A relative score summarizing the regional recreational significance 
            based on the Area_ac, Park, and Pwa fields. The value is a 1, 2, or 
            3, with a value of three being more regionally important for 
            recreational use. 

WS_CLASS:   A relative score summarizing the regional water supply significance 
            based on the criteria presented in the Regional Aquatic Assessment 
            Procedures document.  Data were obtained through a review of 
            regional and local water supply plans on file at the Metropolitan 
            Council.  The value is a 1, 2, or 3, with a value of three being 
            more regionally important for water supply use. 

HU_CLASS:   A relative rank of the overall human use significance of the lake 
            based on the recreational and water supply significance. The value 
            is a 1, 2, or 3, with a value of three being the most significant 
            for overall human use.  The human use class is the maximum of the 
            recreational class and the water supply class.</eaover>
