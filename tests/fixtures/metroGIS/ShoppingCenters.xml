The shopping center point locations were derived from a list of addresses that had some problems when address matched to street centerlines.  Some addresses were modified to improve address matching results.

Some of the resulting points were repositioned for cartographic purposes and labeling for the published Major Shopping Centers map (Publication No. 74-00-035).  Thus, some of the points, especially in major shopping center areas, are not in their precise location (e.g. the points might not fall on the actual shopping center).</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srcscale></srcscale></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>The Metropolitan Council research staff developed a database of shopping centers with ID numbers, addresses, gross square footage, year of construction, year renovated, and center type (regional, sub-regional, etc.) from the sources listed below.  Not all of these attributes were carried through to the final point data file.  

This database was address matched with ArcView 3.2 using the TLG Street Centerlines dataset.  Some of the addresses were modified during this process to achieve better address matching results.  Some of the resulting points were then repositioned for cartographic purposes for the published Major Shopping Centers map (Publication No. 74-00-035).  Some of the points, especially in major shopping center locations, are not in their precise location (e.g. the points might not fall on the actual shopping center).
