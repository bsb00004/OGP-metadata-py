The data was collected through review of public documents provided online by the Minnesota Department of Health at http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/wells/swca/index.html. This dataset includes general information about the name of the Special Well Construction Area, the agency responsible for the area, some of the primary contaminants detected at the site, some general information about the distribution of certain contaminants, the county or counties affected by the management area, and the date that the area was mapped.</abstract><purpose>The 2005 Minnesota Legislature directed the Metropolitan Council to "carry out planning activities addressing the water supply needs of the metropolitan area" (Minnesota Statutes, Section 473.1565). Specifically the Council is charged with developing a base of technical information for water supply planning decisions and to prepare a metropolitan area master water supply plan. This dataset supports this charge.</purpose><supplinf>Twin Cities Seven County Metropolitan Area.
