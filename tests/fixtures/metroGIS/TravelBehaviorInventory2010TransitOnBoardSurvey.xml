The TBI is a battery of surveys conducted 2010-2012 to support transportation planning and transportation forecast model development.

Dataset includes record surveyed in 2010, as well as some records from 2005 for routes that were not surveyed in 2010.  Four expansion factors were developed, all matching systemwide totals:
Allsys- All records, at route level
ODsys-All records with O/D information, at route level
ODTPsys- All records with O/D and purpose information, at route level
ODTP_Geosys- All records with O/D and purpose information, at segment level

Please refer to documentation for information about sample plan, survey instruments, field implementation, and data expansion.</abstract><purpose>To assist the Twin Cities Metropolitan Planning Organization with transportation planning and project programming in the Twin Cities region.</purpose><supplinf>2010 transit system and orgins/destinations of surveyed users</supplinf></descript><keywords><place><placekey>Twin Cities, Anoka County, Carver County, Dakota County, Hennepin County, Ramsey County, Scott County, Washington County, Sherburne County</placekey></place><theme><themekey>Travel Behavior Inventory, TBI, transit, transit on-board survey, on-board, OBS</themekey></theme></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>Metropolitan Council</cntorg><cntper>Jonathan Ehrlich</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>Senior Planner</cntpos><cntaddr><address>390 Robert Street North</address><city>St. Paul</city><state>MN</state><postal>55101-1805</postal></cntaddr><cntvoice>651.602.1408</cntvoice><cntemail>jonathan.ehrlich@metc.state.mn.us</cntemail></cntinfo></ptcontac></idinfo><distinfo><distliab>NOTICE:  The Data to which this notice is attached are made available pursuant to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (Minnesota Statutes Chapter 13).
