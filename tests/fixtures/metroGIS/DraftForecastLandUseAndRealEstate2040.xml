The file details the land use and real estate characteristic data informing the local forecast model.  The information in this file originate from a number of different data sources. 
 The calculation of planned land use acres and allowable housing types  is based on Regional Planned Land Use for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area file, which is a compilation of individual land use plans from communities within the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area into a single regional data layer.   
Estimated average residential zonal land consumption and average zonal lot sizes were estimated using a combination of 2010 Census ACS housing unit counts, 2010 Census counts of owner and rental households, and summarizations of both the 2010 Generalized Land Use and parcel data.

Estimated nonresidential land use (per 1,000 square feet) are based on analysis of 2010 Generalized Land Use, Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data, and Minnesota Commercial Association of Realtors (MnCAR) data.  

Estimated average zonal residential finished square footage values used summarizations of parcel data, Minnesota Area Association of Realtors (MAAR data), and GVA Marquette data.  

Estimated average zonal residential rents were calculated based on data from the 2010 ACS Census data and analysis of Minnesota Area Association of Realtors (MAAR data) sales data. 

Estimated average zonal nonresidential rents were calculated using analysis of MnCAR data.

Supply costs were estimated by combining estimations of land supply costs and building costs.  Land supply costs were estimated using geographically weighted averaging of county accessors data for vacant parcels.  Average zonal monthly residential construction costs were estimated using summarizations of US Department of Commerce building permit data (for single family attached and multifamily housing) and RSMeans Residential Cost data (for single family detached housing).   Average zonal monthly nonresidential construction costs were estimated using Metropolitan Council nonresidential building permit data.  For zones that were considered fully developed (defined as &gt;85% of land developed),  estimated supply costs were raised 50% to account for additional costs associated with redevelopment.
