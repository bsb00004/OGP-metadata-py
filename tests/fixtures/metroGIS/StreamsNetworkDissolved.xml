The Streams Network layer was developed by taking the Mn/DOT steams layers from the Mn/DOT Base Maps series (digitized from 1:24,000 USGS quad maps) and connecting stream segments through lakes and wetlands.  

Breaks in stream network continuity and lake drainage were filled using a variety of data sources.  Working in major watershed tiles, DNR lakes and wetlands (of NWI origin) were used to create connector arcs through these features.  Further connections were interpreted by referencing 24k USGS Digital Raster Graphics, and, selectively, by analysis of DOQs produced by the Metropolitan Council.  Subsurface drainage was added using maps and descriptions from numerous Watershed Management Organization reports and municipalities.  To prepare the coverage for further processing, braided streams were removed from the network.  The above named source materials were used to determine primary channels when choosing the appropriate arc to represent the stream.  Finally, the major watersheds were joined together into one metropolitan area wide coverage.  Topology was verified.

Many of the original stream arcs did not coincide with lake shores.  To ensure the presence of a node at every point where a lake connector and stream feature meet, an IDENTITY was performed with the lakes coverage.  Attributes were updated appropriately.

Once the network was determined to be complete, a network TRACE was run to verify connectivity and flag those arcs flowing in the wrong direction.  Corrections were made so that the resulting stream network has all arcs flowing downhill, and connections are true.  The original major watershed extents were clipped to the project area.  This area is represented by a 300 meter buffered set of the 89 24k quads that intersect the minor watersheds intersecting the seven county metropolitan area.  Many arcs remained isolated from the network.  All those over 500 meters long were verified to flow in the right direction.

Tolerance values for the coverage were set as follows:
Fuzzy:   0.100
Dangle:   10.000 Verified
Tic Match:   0.000
Edit:   10.000 Verified
Node Snap:   10.000 Verified
Weed:   1 Verified
Grain:   10 Verified
Snap:   3.000 Verified


JULY 2000

DNR reviewed the metro streams product and conducted a comprehensive data quality review and editing process, focused primarily on data completeness issues.  DNR staff used the 7.5 minute Digital Raster Graphics (DRG's) as the principal reference source during the editing process.  DNR 24K Lakes were also used in the editing process.  The work was conducted in ARC/INFO Workstation Version 8.02, using ARCEDIT.

During the course of the work, numerous stream reaches were added and a variety of edits to existing features were made, including: extending streams, moving streams, deleting small spurious features, and snapping to lake polygon boundaries.  DNR staff also tagged those features which are designated trout streams.  Very few streams were actually deleted and redigitized during the process.  Rather, the process was focused on making the data consistent with other portions of the DNR 24K Streams layer with regards to structure, content, and consistency of representation.

JULY - SEPTEMBER 2002

To facilitate a management level assessment, stream features were aggregated into larger, relatively homogenous segments. The Strahler stream order was calculated for all arc features in this dataset using the Strahler extension downloaded from the ESRI script library. Met Council developed another script to find all connected stream arcs where the Strahler stream order was equal and assign a unique stream ID. Stream arcs were then dissolved (arcs were merged into larger segments) based on this unique stream ID. Streams longer than 10 km were manually split at DNR minor watershed boundaries and stream IDs were renumbered.</procdesc>

		<overview>
			<eaover>STREAM_ID:  A unique numeric identifier for each stream segment.  Stream 
            segments were aggregated from the digitized features of the 
            original source data layer.  Stream features were aggregated 
            according to Strahler stream order and connectivity.  Initially, 
            all stream features that had the same stream order and were 
            connected in an upstream-downstream relationship were aggregated 
            using an ArcInfo dissolve process.  Stream segements longer than 
            10,000 meters were then manually split at DNR minor watershed 
            boundaries.

COUNT:      A count of the number of features from the original data that were 
            aggregated to create the stream segment.

OLD_ID:     The stream identification number from the first draft of the 
            aquatic assessment.

STRAHLER:   The stream order number for each segment based on the Strahler 
            stream order system.

LENGTH:     The length of the stream segment in meters.

SPLIT:      A boolean variable (Y/N) that indicates if the segment was manually 
            split from a longer segment at the DNR minor watershed boundary.</eaover>
