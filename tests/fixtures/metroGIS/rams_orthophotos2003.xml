Standard Deviation (sigma) = 1.6710356970
Root Mean Square X = 1.9970393211

Scanner setting:
Transmissivity: 0.0151 0.6610
Film Density: 1.8210 0.1778
Gamma: 1.75
Quality Control Procedures:
Film was kept in airtight containers prior to scanning.  Both the base
and emulsion sides of the film were cleaned using a tacky roller system prior to
scanning. Color adjustment was achieved by visually matching the tone, contrast,
and brightness to the original film. Each scanned image was checked
computationally for missing data.
Quality Control Procedures for orthophoto production:
After individual orthophotos were mosaiced into a regional database,
the resulting orthophoto composite was visually inspected for tone balance and
image distortion.  In areas of image distortion, more suitable orthophoto
imagery was inserted, when possible.  The final orthophotos were visually
inspected for accuracy and consistency.</procdesc></procstep><srcinfo><srcscale>2400</srcscale></srcinfo></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><indspref></indspref><direct>Raster</direct><mgmg3obj></mgmg3obj><mgmg3til></mgmg3til></spdoinfo><spref><horizsys><geograph><latres></latres><longres></longres></geograph><planar><gridsys><gridsysn>County Coordinates</gridsysn><utm><utmzone></utmzone></utm><spcs><spcszone></spcszone></spcs><mgmg4coz>43</mgmg4coz><mgmg4adj></mgmg4adj></gridsys><mapproj><mapprojn></mapprojn><mgmg4par></mgmg4par><otherprj></otherprj></mapproj><planci><plandu>Feet</plandu><coordrep><absres>0.500000</absres><ordres>0.500000</ordres></coordrep></planci></planar><geodetic><ellips>GRS80</ellips><horizdn>NAD83</horizdn></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><overview><eaover>ZEISS RMK TOP 15 Calibrated focal length: 152.773 mm.
