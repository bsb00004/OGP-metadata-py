<?xml version="1.0"?><metadata><eainfo><overview><eaover>Attributes for Tabular Data: 

YEAR: The year the permit was issued. 

CO_CODE: 3 digit FIPS and state standard county ID code 
003 = Anoka County 
019 = Carver County 
037 = Dakota County 
053 = Hennepin County 
123 = Ramsey County 
139 = Scott County 
163 = Washington County 

CTU_ID: The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) official federal unique identifier for each city, township or unorganized territory. 

CTU_CODE: 5 digit FIPS55 'Place' code for CTU. As of 2006 these codes have been officially retired by the federal government. They are replaced by the GNIS codes below. The Census Bureau will continue to create FIPS55 Place codes for new cities and townships through the 2010 Census. After that, no new FIPS55 codes will be created. Note that for townships that wholly incorporate into cities, the same FIPS55 code for 
the former township will usually be used for the new city. Conversely, GNIS creates a new ID for the new city. 

CTU_NAME: Name of the city, township or unorganized territory, e.g. Benton Twp., Blaine. 

CO_NAME: Name of county.

Address: Address of residential units.

TYPE: Designation of project into one of 3 building type categories. 

UNITS: Number of units.

Respondents are asked to provide project information for new residential units.

For this shapefile, only attached housing units are included. 

A small number of communities each year may not provide data. These are typically places with no residential construction occurring. 

The data on returned surveys were verified by Metropolitan Council staff through various means including: contact with community staff, community websites, and comparison to data in the Council's Service Availability Charge (SAC) reports where possible. 

For this data, projects are counted at the time local units of government issue building permits.
