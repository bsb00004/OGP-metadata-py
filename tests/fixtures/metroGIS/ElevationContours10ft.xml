Digital line graph (DLG) data are digital representations of cartographic information. DLG's of map features are converted to digital form from maps and related sources.  All DLG data distributed by the USGS are DLG - Level 3 (DLG-3), which means the data contain a full range of attribute codes, have full topological structuring, and have passed certain quality-control checks.

Notes:  
- ''Depth curves'' for lakes are included in this layer.
- Quad tiles were not edgematched, therefore contours do not necessarily line up across tile boundaries.
- Some DLG vectors represent more than one elevation (e.g., a cliff).
- Entire seven county geographic area is covered.</abstract><purpose>These data represent iso-elevation contours of surface terrain.

-  USGS 7.5-Minute Hypsography DLG Data which included 88 quadrangles which cover the Twin Cities' Metro area.

HISTORY OF THE Hypsography/Elevation Line Data:

Using an ArcInfo AML programming, a hypsography/elevation layer was extracted from the USGS 7.5-Minute Hypsography DLG Data which included 88 quadrangles in the vicinity of Minneapolis/St. Paul.  

The AML was written to process the USGS data using the following steps:

An AML command selected and extracted elevation lines with 10 foot intervals and convert them into a vector format as an ArcInfo line coverage; 

The data were then merged into a single coverage and converted to an ArcView shapefile format.</procdesc></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><indspref>None</indspref><direct>Vector</direct><mgmg3obj>arcs and nodes</mgmg3obj><mgmg3til>One layer for entire region, or individual county tiles.</mgmg3til></spdoinfo><spref><vertdef><altsys><altdatum>NGVD29</altdatum><altunits>Feet</altunits></altsys><depthsys><depthdn></depthdn><depthdu></depthdu></depthsys></vertdef><horizsys><planar><gridsys><gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn><utm><utmzone>15</utmzone></utm></gridsys><planci><plandu>meters</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>NAD83</horizdn><ellips>GRS80</ellips></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><overview><eaover>Line Attributes:
