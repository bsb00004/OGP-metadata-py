This dataset defines hydraulic head (meters above mean sea level) for each active cell in the model simulations of 2010, 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050 demand conditions that assume continued development of traditional supply sources. This dataset is a direct output of the Metro Model 2, developed by Barr Engineering Company, Inc. for the Metropolitan Council to support the development of a regional master water supply plan.

More information about this process is provided in the 2009 Metropolitan Council report 'Twin Cities Metropolitan Area Regional Groundwater Flow Model Version 2.00 - Technical Report in Support of the Metropolitan Area Master Water Supply Plan', which is available online at www.metrocouncil.org/environment/WaterSupply/metrogroundwatermodeldatasets.htm.</abstract><purpose>The 2005 Minnesota Legislature directed the Metropolitan Council to "carry out planning activities addressing the water supply needs of the metropolitan area" (Minnesota Statutes, Section 473.1565). Specifically the Council is charged with developing a base of technical information for water supply planning decisions and to prepare a metropolitan area master water supply plan.

Models are abstract approximations of reality; therefore, all models have inherent uncertainty imbedded within them. This uncertainty within the model will always lead to some uncertainty in any predictions made by the model. Sources of uncertainty in the Metro Model 2 stem from:

- An incomplete understanding of the geologic conditions in the Twin Cities area, including the presence of undetected features (e.g., faults, changes in glacial deposits);	

- An incomplete understanding of groundwater flow conditions in the Twin Cities;

- Data gaps in groundwater levels (particularly for deeper aquifers);

- Data gaps on the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers and aquitard due to a small set of existing pumping tests;

- Undocumented or unreported groundwater withdrawals;

- Limited base-flow data for streams (particularly for the Mississippi River through Minneapolis and St. Paul);

- Limited or non-existent information on the permeability of lake bottoms;

- The necessary simplifications, lumping of conditions, and time-averaging of observations that is needed in order to build and calibrate a groundwater flow model;

- Incomplete and evolving understanding of how and where recharge through infiltration takes place;

- The need to exclude very detailed, site-specific hydrogeologic data in a regional model; and

- The conceptualization of groundwater flow on a regional basis for the purpose of this model (the evaluation of groundwater supply).

Continuing efforts must be made to reduce model uncertainty and increase model uniqueness. As new data are obtained and new understandings of regional hydrogeology evolve, the model will be re-optimized. In particularly, the following types of information will likely have an impact on reducing model uncertainty:

- New estimates of hydraulic conductivity from new pumping tests (expressed as prior knowledge in the model)
- Additional calibration data, such as synoptic water levels and baseflow data
- Better understanding of the water-transmitting characteristics of the glacial drift deposits
- Refined estimates of recharge, particularly leakage from lakes</attraccr></attracc><complete>The entire seven county geographic area is covered</complete><lineage><procstep><procdesc>2030 and 2050 water demand was projected for each municipality or municipal water supply system in the Twin Cities metropolitan area using the method described in the 2009 Metropolitan Council report 'Twin Cities Metropolitan Area Regional Groundwater Flow Model Version 2.00 - Technical Report in Support of the Metropolitan Area Master Water Supply Plan', which is available online at www.metrocouncil.org/environment/WaterSupply/metrogroundwatermodeldatasets.htm.

Calculated water demand greater than the average 1995-2005 pumping rate of existing wells in each community was assumed to be supplied by new wells. An ESRI ArcGIS shapefile of new wells was created to accomodate unmet projected 2030 and 2050 demand for each community. Wells were randomly distributed throughout the community and assigned to the primary aquifer already being used in that community.

The new well shapefile was then imported into the regional groundwater flow model using Groundwater Vistas (Version 5.0) (Environmental Simulations, Inc. 2007). A groundwater flow model scenario was run for each of the demand projection years and model-predicted aquifer drawdown (compared to average 1995-2005 conditions) was recorded.

Model results were exported for each model layer as ESRI Spatial Analyst raster files for use in GIS programs such as ArcGIS.</procdesc></procstep><srcinfo><srcscale></srcscale></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc Sync="TRUE">Dataset copied.</procdesc><srcused Sync="TRUE">N:\EQA\WaterSupply\MAPS_Make_A_Map\MAM_WaterSupply_2Mar09\MAM_WatSUp_Metadata_23Apr09\MM2_ProjHdDEM</srcused><procdate Sync="TRUE">20091208</procdate><proctime Sync="TRUE">10043000</proctime></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><indspref></indspref><direct>Raster</direct><mgmg3obj></mgmg3obj><mgmg3til></mgmg3til></spdoinfo><distinfo><distliab>NOTICE: The Geographic Information System (GIS) Data to which this notice is attached are made available pursuant to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (Minnesota Statutes Chapter 13).
