The city and township boundaries used to create this dataset were derived from the metro wide city and township boundary dataset described at http://www.datafinder.org/metadata/CountiesAndCTUs.htm  That dataset is updated on a quarterly basis. This dataset is then recreated quarterly from those boundaries, the date reflected in the Time Period of Content.</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>As Needed</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-94.012</westbc><eastbc>-92.732</eastbc><northbc>45.415</northbc><southbc>44.471</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><place><placekey>Twin Cities, Anoka County, Carver County, Dakota County, Hennepin County, Ramsey County, Scott County, Washington County</placekey></place><theme><themekey>Metropolitan Parks and Open Space Commission, Metropolitan Council, administrative boundaries</themekey><themekt>None</themekt></theme></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>None</useconst><browse><browsen>None available</browsen><browsed></browsed></browse><crossref><citeinfo><title>Metropolitan Council District Boundaries, County and MCD boundary layers compiled by the Metropolitan Council.</title></citeinfo></crossref><native>ArcGIS 9x</native><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntorg>Metropolitan Council</cntorg><cntper>Craig Skone</cntper></cntperp><cntpos>GIS Specialist</cntpos><cntaddr><address>390 Robert Street North</address><city>St. Paul</city><state>MN</state><postal>55101-1805</postal></cntaddr><cntvoice>651.602.1328</cntvoice><cntemail>craig.skone@metc.state.mn.us</cntemail></cntinfo></ptcontac></idinfo><dataqual><attracc><attraccr>Attributes are accurate as of the Currentness Reference date.</attraccr></attracc><logic>The dataset is topologically 'clean'.</logic><complete>Entire seven county geographic area is covered.</complete><posacc><horizpa><horizpar>The positional accuracy of the dataset has not been tested under the National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy.
