The file uses several datasets to calculate base year (2010) conditions and forecast year (2040) assumptions.  

The 2010 water buffers used the Generalized Land Use - 2010 for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area.

The 2010 park buffer used the Generalized Land Use - 2010 for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area.  The 2040 park buffer brings in assumptions from the 2030 Regional Parks Policy Plan regarding regional parks and regional park search areas.

The 2010 percent Metropolitan Urban Service Area (MUSA) used the Metropolitan Urban Service Areas (MUSA) Composite - Year 2020 outline to calculate the percent of the TAZ served by the MUSA in 2010.  The 2040 percent MUSA is based on the Metropolitan Urban Service Areas (MUSA) Composite - Year 2030 outline

The 2010 TAZ level percent of low income households, average zonal household income, and percent of households with a White householder are based on 2010 Census data.  The 2010 housing density calculation uses the 2010 Census data and the Generalized Land Use - 2010 for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area.

The Central Business District (CBD) uses designations from the Council's Travel Demand Model.

The 2010 High Frequency Bus Stop field uses the existing High Frequency Transit Network.  

The 2040 High Frequency Bus Stop field includes additional high frequency transit service taken from the 2013-2016 Regional Service Improvement Plan.  The 2040 High Frequency Bus Stop field also includes assumptions about future arterial bus rapid transit (BRT) service, which are treated as high frequency bus service.

The 2010 percent Light Rail Transit station (LRT) uses the Hiawatha alignment to calculate the percent of a TAZ that falls within a 1/2-mile buffer of each station.  

The 2040 percent LRT stations adds assumptions about LRT stations along the Central Corridor, Southwest Transitway and Bottineau Corridor alignments.  The 2040 percent LRT station variable also includes highway BRT stations, and includes highway BRT service along Cedar Avenue and I-35W, and assumes future highway BRT service along the Gateway Corridor, TH-65, I-35E and TH-36.
