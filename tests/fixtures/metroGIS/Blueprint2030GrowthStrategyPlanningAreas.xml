			<abstract>This dataset depicts the  the various Blueprint 2030 planning areas shown in Council's Blueprint 2030 Growth Strategy map.  This map is part of the Metropolitan Council Blueprint 2030 adopted December 18, 2002.  This document is on hold with the current Metropolitan Council and will be revised in the near future.  See http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/blueprint2030/overview.htm for more information.

Please refer to the actual Blueprint 2030 Growth Strategy map for the actual details of the Blueprint.  A digital version can be found at http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/planning_images/BPgsmap.jpg .

See Lineage in Section 2 of this metadata for more information.

Notes:
 - At the time of adoption, Lake Elmo's comprehensive plan was not completed.  The manner in which the city of Lake Elmo is depicted in this dataset is considered to be illustrative only.  
 - Also at the time of adoption, the City of Rockford was considered to be a Rural Center.  Since then the city has opted out of Metropolitan Council jurisdiction.</abstract>

			<current>Planning areas were first defined to analyze land use and development trends and socio-economic characteristics to assist in preparing the Council's 1975 Metropolitan Development Framework.  They have subsequently been used for a wide range of general analysis purposes.  These areas were defined to reflect stage of development of metropolitan area communities.  A major factor in their determination has been the proportion of land developed.  As such, these areas have been periodically adjusted to reflect the continued outward growth of the region.  The latest revision was finalized in the current Blueprint 2030, adopted on December 18, 2002.  It reflected the Council's 2000 land use inventory data, 2000 census information and input from communities.</current>

				<procdesc>Source data used to define the Geographic Planning Areas of the Growth Strategy
- 2000 Municipal Boundaries
- 2000 Generalized Land Use
- Comprehensive Plan Composite data from early in 2002 (communities that had not completed their comprehensive plan review process included Rockford, Minnetonka Beach, Shorewood, Eden Prairie, Jordan, Ham Lake, Linwood Twp., Lake Elmo, St. Mary's Point, New Market and Elko)

Many boundaries from the Comprehensive Plan Composite data were generalized to portray a more general growth strategy policy. 

The Growth Strategy that was adopted on December 18, 2002 was a map that also included:
- Regional Natural Resource Areas (including Terrestrial and Wetland Areas) from the Metro DNR in coordination with the Metropolitan Council (Preliminary Regionally Significant Natural Resources Areas)
- Regional Parks (Regional Recreation Open Space Features)
- 2 proposed Regional Parks (Metropolitan Council Parks and Recreation staff)
- Existing, Planned and Proposed Regional and State Trails (Park Operating Agencies) 
- Transit 2025 Corridor (Transitways on Dedicated Rights-of-Way, 2025 dataset)
- Principal Arterials (Functional Class Roads and Proposed Functional Class Roads, 2002, Principal Arterials only)

Planning Area Definitions and Strategies for Geographic Planning Areas are available in the BP 2030 document at 
http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/blueprint2030/documents.htm .  (See p. 42 Appendix B)</procdesc>
