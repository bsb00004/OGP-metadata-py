The concept was initially developed in 1996 Transit Redesign to provide general guidelines on the mix of transit services that may be appropriate for a given area. This guidance is provided for broad regional context; appropriate transit services are defined through professional transit service planning processes.

The existing market area definitions identify four market areas, with area 1 having the highest densities and area 4 having the lowest densities. These market areas were developed in the 1996 Transit Redesign report produced by the Metropolitan Council.
In 2008, this measure was updated to better reflect census geography and to redefine areas of transit dependence (population over 16 minus available autos). Market index scores were aggregated to contiguous areas and adopted into the Metropolitan Council’s 2030 Transportation Policy Plan.
